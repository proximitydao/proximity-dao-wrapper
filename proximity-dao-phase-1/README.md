#### Project Description

##### Pitch

**Problem**:

Sustainability issues are typically *not* tackled
at or near their source,
and those with the most to lose
(especially to climate change),
typically have the least to say about it.
This results in the underlying issues being tackled
with not only the obvious unequal allocation of resources,
but also in sub-optimal utilisation of those resources.

What if there was a way to allocate and utilise funds
in a much more egalitarian manner?

**Solution**:

This team envisions Proximity DAO,
which is a decentralised application
that allows participants to vote on sustainability issues.
Its voting outcomes are used to decide and allocate
funding for these issues.

What makes this DAO different is that
there is greater weight given to votes
from those **most directly affected**.
To ensure that this truly happens,
the proposed solution makes use of
a novel **bi-variate quadratic voting** mechanism
