#### Project Description

##### Pitch

**Problem**:

Sustainability issues are typically *not* tackled
at or near their source,
and those with the most to lose
(especially to climate change),
typically have the least to say about it.
This results in the underlying issues being tackled
with not only the obvious unequal allocation of resources,
but also in sub-optimal utilisation of those resources.

What if there was a way to allocate and utilise funds
in a much more egalitarian manner?

**Solution**:

This team envisions Proximity DAO,
which is a decentralised application
that allows participants to vote on sustainability issues.
Its voting outcomes are used to decide and allocate
funding for these issues.

What makes this DAO different is that
there is greater weight given to votes
from those **most directly affected**.
To ensure that this truly happens,
the proposed solution makes use of
a novel **bi-variate quadratic voting** mechanism

##### Uses cases for the project

**(1)** Allocation of funds to sustainability projects

Recipients: Individuals or projects

This is the most basic objective of the project.
The DAO receives funds from it members
and those funds are henceforth controlled solely by the DAO.
These funds may only be disbursed when
the DAO's members collectively decide to to do so,
and only in the specific manner that they allow.

When funds are disbursed, the DAO decides on attributes
such as who to disburse it to,
how much to disburse,
and the specific mechanisms and rules that apply to it.

**(2)** Micro-lending

Recipients: Individuals

This is inspired by Grameen bank, from Bangladesh,
which disburses funds to unbanked/ underbanked segments
of the population who are unable to increase their
economic opportunities due to a lack of access to loans.

The DAO may implement micro-lending mechanisms
to those who meet the criteria as one of its allocation mechanisms.

**(3)** Universal basic income

Recipients: Individuals

This is where funds are disbursed on a regular basis
to an entire qualifying population.

The DAO may implement universal basic income
as one of its allocation mechanisms.

**(4)** Payment for permanent GHG removal

Recipients: Projects

This is where funds are disbursed to a project
which captures and stores greenhouse gases.
This is measured not only in terms of
the quantity of carbon dioxide equivalent that is removed,
but also in terms of the duration for which it is stored.

The DAO may implement an escrow based system
to allocate funds on a time-locked tranche basis
to these projects based on performance.

The DAO not only votes of the initial allocation
but also vote on the accuracy of
the claimed greenhouse gas removals and storage,
perhaps even commissioning independent audits.
This would affect the amounts disbursed to the project
and the timeline.

**(5)** Payment for renewable energy production and storage

Recipients: Projects

This is where funds are disbursed to projects that
produce and store renewable energy.
This is measured not only in terms of
the quantity of energy produced,
but also the duration for which the energy can be stored.
For example sub-day duration gets the lowest multiplier,
whereas seasonal duration storage gets the highest multiplier.

The DAO may implement an escrow based system
to allocate funds on a time-locked tranche basis
to these projects based on performance.

The DAO not only votes of the initial allocation
but also vote on the accuracy of
the claimed energy production and storage,
perhaps even commissioning independent audits.
This would affect the amounts disbursed to the project
and the timeline.
